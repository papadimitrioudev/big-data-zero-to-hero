# Learning Python from Zero (ATBS)

This repository documents my journey of learning Python from scratch
using the book *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*.

The purpose of this repo is simple:
- Learn Python step by step, starting from zero.
- Practice only what each chapter introduces.
- Keep a clear, honest record of progress over time.

This is not an advanced Python repository.
It is a learning log.

## What This Repository Contains

- Code examples based exclusively on chapters from:
  *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*
- One folder per chapter (when code is needed).
- Simple scripts that focus only on the concepts of that chapter.

Not every chapter has a README or complex structure.
Some chapters are simple and only include basic scripts.

## Repository Structure

- `ATBS/`
  - `Chapter_01/`
  - `Chapter_02/`
  - ...
  - `Chapter_16/`

Each chapter folder may contain:
- one or more Python scripts
- optionally a README if explanation is useful
- minimal structure, no unnecessary boilerplate

## How to Use This Repository

This repository is primarily for personal learning and tracking progress.

To run code:
1. Enter a chapter folder.
2. Locate the Python script.
3. Run it with Python.

Example:

cd ATBS/Chapter_16
python main.py

## Notes

- The code starts very basic and improves gradually.
- No skipped steps or advanced abstractions.
- Generated files and temporary artifacts are not committed.
